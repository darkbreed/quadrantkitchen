Last week we said goodbye to our flat, we loved the place and it has many happy memories, it also gave name to Quadrant Kitchen. I toyed with the idea of changing the name of the blog to suit as our new address could provide an equally good name, but ultimately I've decided not to change the name of the website so the Quadrant Kitchen is staying as it is and it has had a total overhaul ready for a new chapter. 

Moving from a two bedroom flat with a (pretty decent sized) balcony to a 3 bedroom house witha huge garden, garage and shed hopefully means more space to grow, brew and experimnet! For the last 3 months we have been living somewhat in limbo, running the fridge and the cupboards down so they are almost empty so we have been living on quick salads, pub grub and takeaway food. Now we are in and settle things can get back to normal and we can start eating like real people again.

I have so many things I want to do that I am having trouble deciding what to do first, but don't worry as soon as we are moved in properly and settled I will be blogging about the decisions I've made!

### The site
The site originally started out as a Tumblr blog but that didn't fulfil all my requirements, I then moved to Drupal and the site was running on that for around a year.  

I soon got fed up of using Drupal as it was too big and cumbersome for my needs even though I had a lot of experience with it at the time. Up next was Wordpress, I was swayed by the presenece of an iPhone / iPad app and I thought I would update the site 'on the go', which of course I didn't ever do. The main reason for leaving Wordpress behind was the styling layer to be honest, much to complex and not very friendly to use even for an experienced web developer - if I never touch another Wordpress site I will be a happy man!

So I've gone back to basics this time. This site has no CMS behind it, no big clumsy databases and no fancy WYSIWYG text editors for uploading content, this is now a static site. There is a bit of cleverness going on behind the scenes as it uses [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io) a static site generator for those that are interested in such things. 

What does it mean for the site? Well hopefully because all the complexity of keeping it up to date has been taken away it means I can focus on making it look awesome and adding the features that I've wanted from the start. 

I'll be adding new bits and pieces over the coming weeks and I hope this will become the site I've always wanted it to be.

Right, time to start unpacking. The sooner we finish, the sooner we can get cooking!
