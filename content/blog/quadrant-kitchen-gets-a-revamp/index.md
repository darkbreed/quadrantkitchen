So here it is, the new site. I have ignored this site for so long now that I had to almost force myself to update things. It's been a long journey really and with a house move pending and space to do much more in terms of cooking, curing, brewing etc. I thought it was time for an update.

The site originally started out as a Tumblr blog but that didn't fulfil all my requirements, I then moved to Drupal and the site was running on that for around a year.  

I soon got fed up of using Drupal as it was too big and cumbersome for my needs even though I had a lot of experience with it at the time. Up next was Wordpress, I was swayed by the presenece of an iPhone / iPad app and I thought I would update the site 'on the go', which of course I didn't ever do. The main reason for leaving Wordpress behind was the styling layer to be honest, much to complex and not very friendly to use even for an experienced web developer - if I never touch another Wordpress site I will be a happy man!

So I've gone back to basics this time. This site has no CMS behind it, no big clumsy databases and no fancy WYSIWYG text editors for uploading content, this is now a static site. There is a bit of cleverness going on behind the scenes as it uses [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io) a static site generator for those that are interested in such things. 

What does it mean for the site? Well hopefully because all the complexity of keeping it up to date has been taken away it means I can focus on making it look awesome and adding the features that I've wanted from the start. 

I'll be adding new bits and pieces over the coming weeks and I hope this will become the site I've always wanted it to be.

Watch this space!
