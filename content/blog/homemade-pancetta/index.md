... 

About a week ago I wrote a post about our first attempts at homemade charcuterie, at the point of writing we had tasted the beef jerky, corned beef and the duck breasts but the pancetta was going to take a little longer.

Well, I am pleased to say that these were a success as well! Both pancettas have been hanging in the garage for around 3 weeks after spending a week in the dry cure, so I decided to take one down last night and give it a go and I would say that the results are the best yet. Not to salty, not to dry and the muslin cloth had managed to protect the meat well while it was hanging, not bad for a first effort I would say! We used some of it straight away in a Pea, porcini and pancetta risotto last night and it tasted just as good as the stuff you get in the Italian supermarkets. 

This Pancetta was made with regular table salt, sugar, juniper berries and black pepper. It was cured for a week in this mixture in an oven dish covered in cling film, turning every day to get an even cure, then removed, rinsed very quickly (you dont want to get much more moisture back into the meat) and then wrapped in muslin cloth and hung in the garage. The muslin cloth is essential, initially I was going to use a tea towel but reading around the web muslin cloth is best as its very thin and allows for better air flow around the meat. I even managed to (almost) master tying things like a proper butcher!

I've learned a few things from these first steps in charcuterie but I think the main one is to keep your efforts small in quantity. I have read a few horror stories from people who have lost tens (if not hundereds) of pounds worth of meat, not to mention the months that have gone into the process by some nastiness getting into the meat while hanging and writing off an entire leg of pork! Although this first attempt has gone well, I think it would be easier to accept a 3 week and £8 loss rather than 18 months and £100.

Also keeping your cuts of meat small means that you can use regular kitchen equipment and will not need to buy any specialist kit. So far I haven't had to invest in anything bar the ingredients although having said that I think a vacuum sealer may be on the cards as it seems to be the best way to preserve it after hanging - these are only £30-£40 though so it won't break the bank.

So thats Duck Prosciuttio, Pancetta, Corned beef and Jerky done, next up I think I'm going to give Bresola a try... lets see how that one turns out!
