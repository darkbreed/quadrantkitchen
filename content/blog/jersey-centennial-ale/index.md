I've been brewing beer for about 18 months now on and off and have been impressed with the results. The last couple of brews have been from kits, and while the results have been good I've been itching to take it a bit further and get into all grain brewing so I decided to make the most of the last day in a long weekend and dive in.

I have always been a little put off of moving away from the relative safety of the home brew kit, the first kit I did was about 12 months ago and that was the first I had done in a long, long time as I had not had very good results in the past. I was impressed with that batch so I picked up another kit (a New Zealand IPA I believe) and decided to experiment a little by adding some aroma hops after the initial fermentation. I picked up two varieties from our local homebrew shop, [Love to Brew](http://www.lovetobrew.co.uk) and produced two batches from the one kit, one with Saaz hops and one with Centennial hops. Both were pretty good, we are both fans of Czech lager anyway and the Saaz batch tasted almost like the stuff we had in Prague a couple of years ago and the Centennial batch was just as good. Personally I preferred the Centenial batch as it had a (risking sounding like Jilly Goolden here) crisp, citrus and grapefruit flavour to it. 

These hops have been sat in my freezer for a few months now but are still good, so the first batch of all grain brewing I've done is a 1 gallon single variety Centennial ale. I plumped for a 1 gallon batch after reading an [excellent article from The Kitchn about the benefits of brewing in smaller batches](http://www.thekitchn.com/5-reasons-why-i-became-a-1gallon-brewer-beer-sessions-189903), until then I had always assumed I would brew a 5 gallon batch each time as, well, thats what I was used to and it's probably the case for most home brewers.

I have done a lot of reading around the subject of going all grain and it seems quite daunting and if listen to everything in the forums you will undoubtedly come across in your search for recipes, you would probably never take the plunge and would probably stick with a kit. Honestly, homebrewers are a nerdy bunch from what I've seen on these forums and the irony is you would probably never want to go for a beer with these guys! Beer should be simple, we've been making the stuff for centuries so it cannot be that hard and thats exactly the philosphy behind most of my food and drink experiments so my first all grain brew will be no different.

So, whats in it? Well I've used...

* 1.5kg crushed Maris Otter malt
* 5 litres of water plus another 2.5 for sparging.
* 8g Centennial hops for bittering (during the boil)
* 8g Centennail hops for aroma (after the boil)
* 5g West Coast Yeast
* 1/2 tsp Irish Moss seaweed (for clearing the beer)

... and thats it. No extra malt extract, no chemicals etc. Its as nature intended. Now I'm fully expecting this brew to not be as good as my previous brews as I have had a helping hand from professional brewers who put the kits together. I think I may have used a few to many hops and possibly a little too much yeast, but it looks like beer, smells like beer and when I checked this morning the airlock was bubbling away so I know it is fermenting and will be alcoholic. This will now sit in the demijohn for about a week and then I will transfer to a mini keg that we have left over from our housewarming (see this YouTube vidoe on recycling mini kegs - I had no idea you could re-use them). 

### Equipment
All Ineed for this brew was a large pot (pasta pots or stock pots work well), a plastic fermentation bucket, a grain bag, a drinks cooler (I'll explain, don't worry) and a demijohn. The drinks cooler is probably the only bit of kit many people won't just have hanging around but it's basically a cool box with a tap and this is used for the mashing stage, you need to keep your malt steeping in hot (64 - 70C) for 75 mins so you need an insualted container. If you are lucky some of the camping stores may still have them and grain bags can be picked up from any homebrew shop.

All in all this brew took much longer than expected, I think I stared around 5 and finished at around 10, but that included plenty of reading of the technique in between stages and cleaning and sterilizing of equipment, washing up etc. I'm sure I will get this down to the 2 hour mark after a little practice. 

I'll post a progress update at the kegging stage and probably another after the first tasting, I'm sure the recipe will need tweaking in terms of quantities but fingers crossed this first attempt will be drinkable.
