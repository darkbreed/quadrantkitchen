Now that we have a bit more space to play with I've finally gotten around to doing something I've wanted to try for a long time, charcuterie.

The flat we used to live in offered limited options in terms of suitable locations for hanging and drying meat, we used to make our own bacon every now and again as this could be done to a basic but effective level with just a dry cure mix and the fridge. However taking it a stage further and hanging the meat to air dry proved difficult due to the lack of any suitable outbuildings and the presence of our cat!

Well, now we have a garage so we have put it to good use over the last couple of weeks and taken our first steps in the world of charcuterie. I've read a fair number of blog posts on the subject but to be honest there is nothing like a good recipe book. I am no reader, I can probably count the number of books I have read in my lifetime on the fingers of two hands and my wife will atest to this but I always look out for good recipe and food reference books, so we bought Dick and Dan Strawbridges 'Smoking and Curing' guide and recipe book and I can highly recommend it for anyone looking to take their first steps in this field. 

### Equipment
I always thought that doing this kind of thing would require some specialist equipment, but you can actually get started with what you already have in your kitchen if you get started with the basics. I have read about curing chambers and people adapting old fridge freezers by cutting lumps out of them and overriding the refridgeration units to create them, all of which seemed totally unnecessary to me and this book has proved it. After all, air drying and curing meat goes back centuries so it clearly does not need to be complicated!

We've tried a couple of recipes from this book so far, duck breast proscuttio, beef jerky, corned beef and also flown solo and attempted pancetta based on reading through the various cured pork recipes and the only equipment we have required is a couple of oven dishes and some cling film to cure the meat in and some muslin cloth and string to wrap the meat in for hanging. For drying the jerky all we have used is a fan oven. We have been using a table top halogen oven as our new house has a gas oven which isn't so great as you need the air circulation, but if you have a fan oven (or a halogen oven) all you need to do is set it to the lowest temperature and leave the door open slightly (or lid slightly off for a halogen) for the moisture to escape and your jerky will dry our perfectly!

### Getting the right ingredients
We used goose skirt for our jerky and this is probably only going to be available at a proper butchers rather than a supermarket (Morrisons may possibly stock it). Reading around rump skirt should work as well but according to the guys at [Ruby and White](http://www.rubyandwhite.co.uk) rump skirt is a little more coarsely grained so I would recommend the goose skirt based on my results so far, but I may also give the rump skirt a go as well. Beef brisket is all you need for corned beef and this should be readily available.

For the duck breast and the pancetta we got our cuts from our local (well, local to work anyway) butcher [Ruby and White](http://www.rubyandwhite.co.uk). The advice on the internet and in the book is to buy the best ingredients you can afford for the best results. You can make this stuff with supermarket meat I am sure and the results would probably be pretty good, but if you can get some locally sourced meat from a good butchers it will taste so much better!

### Time and effort
These recipes have required surprisingly little effort. The beef for the jerky, the two duck breasts, corned beef and two belly pork joints took no more than 45 minutes to prepare and get in the fridge. Most of the time is simply waiting, all you need to do on a daily basis is turn the meat over in the cure mix and drain a little water off every now and again and to be honest, if you don't do this regularly it's not the end of the world in my experience. 

Once the meat has finished curing you will probably spend another hour wrapping it in muslin cloth ready for hanging (depending on how much you have cured) and then its a waiting game again. The duck breasts took about 10 days to dry to a good level and the pancettas are still hanging. The beef jerky took about 6 hours in the halogen to dry but again the effort is minimal, just leave it in the oven. 

### Results
The beef jerky has been a big success, the first batch was left to marinade for a week and took 7 hours to dry properly and was subsequently demolished by the family when they visited! So a second batch has been made already. The corned beef was also a big success and we wolfed that down pretty soon after it was ready as well with some homemade mayonaise and dill pickles.

We opened one of the duck breasts yesterday and sliced into it. I would say it was a success but not quite as good as the jerky, there may have been a little too much salt in the cure mix so I'll adjust the quantities next time around. The pancettas are still hanging so I'll report on them when they are ready.

I guess the thing we have learned most is that this stuff isn't really that hard and is not the preserve of delicatessens and large scale producers, these techniques have humble beginnings, need basic equipment and knowledge and its not an exact science so if you like cured meat you should give it a try, chances are you will be very pleased with the results.
