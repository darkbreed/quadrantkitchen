intro: Foraging in the city, sort of...
... 

Living in the middle of town for a few years meant that we had to get in the car and go and seek out good foraging spots, which inevitably meant that we wouldn't bother much and only did it if we happend upon one when we were out. Moving out into the suburbs means we are closer to green space, but until we actually moved we had no idea what we were about to find on our doorstep.

One of the best things about the location of our new house is that it is close to the excellent [Beeses Tea Gardens](http://www.beeses.co.uk), a gem of a bar and beer garden on the banks of the river Avon (seriously, when you are here you would never think you were only a couple of miles from the city centre and 10 mins from the Bath Road, if you haven't been there then go now! ). Next to Beeses is Eastwood Farm, a 67 acre nature reserve. I have walked along the opposite bank of the river many times to the Old Lock and Wier pub but never really taken the time to explore this side of the river,  so a week or so after moving we decided to take a longer walk to Beeses and go and explore it.

The place is perfect foraging territory, so far we have managed to find blackberries, damsons, elderberry, elderflower and rose hips of various varieties plus a few berries that we haven't been able to identify yet, so we left them where they were.  On the subject of identifying things while out and about, due to having an excellent 3G signal at Eastwood Farm I did what any self respecting geek would do when faced with a challenge... took a photo and asked Twitter for advice! And sure enough within minutes I had a response, [@carllegge](https://twitter.com/carllegge) has been a fantastic resource and really knows his stuff. He has helped me identify a few things so far and I'll probably turn to him again in the future, if you do not already follow him and you are interested in growing, foraging and home cooking then you should.

On the first visit we picked 2kg of blackberries without even making a dent in the supply, I have genuinely never seen so many blackberries in one place before and this year they were all out very early it seems. Unfortunately most of these were not used in time so went off, but we managed to get a good sized jar of blackberry and sloe gin jam plus a blackberry cheesecake out of it so they weren't all wasted! 

We headed down again on Sunday morning last weekend to clear our heads after our house warming party and picked a bagfull of Damsons (before stopping off for a quick on in Beeses again on the way home, well it would have been rude not to). These were turned into damson gin last night, which should be just about perfect for christmas.

Given that all of these berries were out in July / August the foraging season is probably coming to an end pretty soon so you may be running out of time if you want to get picking, but we will definitely be down here again next year for more. 

Recipes for the jam and damson gin will be posted soon!
