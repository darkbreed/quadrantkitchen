As some of you may (or may not know) Julie and I recently got married in Scotland and toured around Argyll and Bute and the islands for our honeymoon before venturing down to the Lake District on the way home for a night. As you can imagine we ate out a lot on our travels and this has provided a few ideas for blog posts here on QK.

Over the next few days I will be uploading some reviews and recommendations from our travels, some good and some bad but hopefully all informative and who knows, some may even inspire you to go and visit this places... well, the good ones at least!

### The Argyll Hotel
The first place we stayed on our travels was Inveraray. We stayed at the <a href="http://www.bespokehotels.com/argyllhotel">Argyll Hotel</a> for a couple of nights before the wedding and while the hotel was nothing special it was comfortable, clean and most importantly the food good, in particular the fish and chips! 

On the first night my dad and I tucked into freshly caught haddock and chips and I must say I wasn't expecting much as I have had many a plate of pub fish and chips and you are usually served frozen, breaded 'white fish' and oven chips.  However when it came out it was a proper chip shop experience, the only thing that was missing was the paper and wooden fork. The batter was crispy all the way through, the fish was stunning and the chips were proper, home cooked chips and were not frozen - all for a tenner, give or take. If you ever stay there I can highly recommend it.

### Loch Fyne Whiskies
Inveraray is also home to one of the best whisky shops in Scotland, <a href="http://www.lfw.co.uk/">Loch Fyne Whiskies</a>. Even if you are not a huge whisky fan, it is still worth a visit and a browse just to take in the atmosphere and talk to the friendly and knowledgeable staff (who are always willing to give you a few tasters). If you are a whiskey drinker, bring all of your pocket money as they have a huge range and lots of special bottlngs, distillers editions and very old whiskeys for sale. You will need deep pockets to take some of these bottles home. 

### The George Hotel
Just across the road from the whisky shop is the <a href="http://www.thegeorgehotel.co.uk/">George Hotel</a>. We visited The George before our wedding but then had to visit again a few days afterwards as we could not get down to our hotel in Campbeltown due to the snow and power failures that week, in fact we had to drive 40 miles back up the peninsula to Inveraray from Tarbert as Inveraray was the closest place that still had power! But we are glad we did, because the George is amazing!

It dates back to 1770 and the owners have done a really good job in keeping the old world feel. There are roaring open fires, subdued lighting and a bar well stocked with local ales, world beers and as you would expect, a huge selection of whiskies and bourbons. On to the food, we were initially a little disappointed when we first arrived in Inveraray that the original Loch Fyne restaurant was closed for refurbishment (the one time we were actually going to be able to eat there!) but not to worry, when the waiter brought us the menu it was accompanied by a second menu with. The Loch Fyne head chef has been collaborating with the chef at the George which has enabled them to serve up some of the best seafood dishes from the Loch Fyne restaurant with ingredients sourced straight from the loch.

I had the Loch Fyne Oysters on ice with red and green hot pepper sauce followed by stunning lobster thermidor. Julie had grilled langoustines in garlic butter followed by the chicken breast (both of which were in-house dishes) and both of which were equally as good! Considering we were supposed to be staying in a spa hotel in Campbeltown and this was essentially emergency accommodation, we could not have asked for more here. The staff were all really helpful and friendly and the room was amazing (we had the master suite, it was our honeymoon after all!)

All in all we spent around Â£170 for the room, evening meal and a full scottish breakfast which I didn't think was too bad all things considered and I don't think we would have had a better evening had we made it to Campbeltown. We will definitely be coming back for seconds.

Thats it for this leg of the trip, the next post will be about our two trips to Oban and the awesome seafood we had there...
