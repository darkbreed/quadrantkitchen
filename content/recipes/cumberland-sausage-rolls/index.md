intro: A northern twist (see what I did there) on the sausage roll... 
...

Another recipe from our week in the Lakes (or rather inspired by), this one came after having cinnamon rolls for breakfast one day and talking about cumberland rings. I thought it would be interesting to combine the two ideas for a breakfast sausage roll, keeping the ring of a traditional cumberland sausage.

### Ingredients
---

* 4 good quality cumberland sausages, at least 85% meat if you can get them.
* 1/2 block of puff pasty
* 1 egg
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* Maple syrup
* Sea salt

### Method
---

1. Pre heat your oven to 200C (gas mark 7) and line a baking tray with grease proof paper.  
2. Flour your work surface and roll out the block of puff pasty to a rectangle of about 1cm thick.
3. Squeeze all of the filling out of the sausages into a bowl and mix together with the cinnamon.
4. Spread the sausage mixture over the pastry, leaving about 1 cm around the edges.
5. Beat the egg so we can use it as a wash then roll the pastry length ways util you can only see the top edge of rhe pastry, brush a little of the egg mixture onto the edge and then roll over, sealing the roll.
6. With a sharp knife (a blunt one will just make a mess here) slice the roll into 6. I got 7 out of mine but one was a little light on filling!  
7. Place the slices on the try and coat in egg wash. Bake for about 20-25 mins until they start to go golden brown.
8. Remove from the oven and brush the maple syrup over the rolls, sprinkle with seasalt and return to the oven for another 10 mins.
9. Remove and place on a cooling rack for a few minutes then tuck in while they are still warm.
