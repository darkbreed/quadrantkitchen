Jambalaya is an awesome one pot dish that originated in the Caribbean, it’s similar to paella and is usually made with rice. This recipe came from a meeting with a lovely lady from Sharpham Park Spelt farm in Harvey Nichols a few weeks back. They are a spelt producer from Glastonbury and we we got chatting and she told me that you can substitute rice for spelt in just about any recipe (works particularly well for risotto apparently) so having had a packet in the cupboard for ages and not known what to do with it, I thought I would give it a go with one of my favourites, Jambalaya.

### Ingredients
---

* 250g Sharpham Farm pearled Spelt
* 4 boneless chicken thighs, sliced
* 3 Toulouse sausages, chopped
* 50g chopped chorizo (I can highly recommend The Bath Pig!)
* 1 whole red bell pepper, seeded and diced
* 1 tin chopped tomatoes
* 1 clove garlic
* 2 stalks of celery, finely chopped
* 2 medium onions, finely chopped
* 250ml chicken stock
* 6-8 raw king prawns
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1/4 tsp hot paprika
* Salt &amp;amp; pepper to season

Jambalaya is an awesome one pot dish that originated in the Caribbean, it’s similar to paella and is usually made with rice. This recipe came from a meeting with a lovely lady from Sharpham Park Spelt farm in Harvey Nichols a few weeks back. They are a spelt producer from Glastonbury and we we got chatting and she told me that you can substitute rice for spelt in just about any recipe (works particularly well for risotto apparently) so having had a packet in the cupboard for ages and not known what to do with it, I thought I would give it a go with one of my favourites, Jambalaya.

1.  Heat some olive oil in a pan and add the garlic, onions, celery, pepper and chorizo. Cook this until the onions start to become translucent and soft. The chorizo will give everything a red glaze and warm paprika flavour.
2.  Next add the chicken thighs and the sausages with the paprika and cayenne. Don’t use cheap sausages for this, make sure you get sausages that are at least 90% pork and make sure they are toulouse style or Italian style sausages not just plain old pork, you need the flavours that come with them as seasoning.
3.  When the chicken and sausages have stared to get a little colour, add your spelt. Stir it around until it’s coated in the garlic and paprika infused oil and then add the tomatoes.
4.  Give everything a good stir around and then add the chicken stock and your prawns, stir some more and season to taste.
5.  Turn your hob down to a medium he’s and simmer until the spelt has absorbed all of the liquids in the pan, serve immediately in warm bowls.
You will think twice about using rice for anything once you have tried this, trust me!
