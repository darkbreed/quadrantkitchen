Sliders are essentially small burgers, the term can refer to any small sandwich served in a bun from what I can gather, but burgers seem to be the most common. Over the weekend we decided not to waste the stunning weather and have a few BBQ’s. There is nothing better than cooking outside and I did not want to buy my burgers, thats not to say there aren’t any good ones around but it’s always more fun (and lets be honest better) making your own. I was also having a bit of an Italian weekend (mainly drinking Peroni) so I decided to carry the theme on into the BBQ. So...

### Ingredients
---

* 400g Beef Mince
* 1 large onion finely chopped
* 1 medium egg beaten
* 2 large garlic cloves grated
* Handful of coarse breadcrumbs
* 1tsp dried Oregano
* handful of fresh Basil finely chopped (plus a few whole to serve)
* 3 decent size sun dried tomatoes finely chopped
* a good grating of parmesan cheese
* a few grinds of Sea salt and black pepper to taste
* 9 small burger buns (or Ciabatta if you want to be totally Italian)
* green pesto
* 1 ball mozzarella
* Mixed leaf salad
* Sliced tomatoes (San Marzano if you can get them, hard to find here in the UK)

### Method
---

1. Mix all of the burger mix ingredients in a bowl until they are combined. I usually find adding 2 or 3 ingredients at a time, mixing them well and then adding another 2 or 3 works best. Keep the egg & breadcrumbs until last.
2. Line a baking tray with grease proof paper and once fully combined, pull away small handfuls of the mixture, roll them into a balls and then flatten into patties. I oil my chopping board to do this to save them from sticking, don’t use flour or you will end up with dry burgers!
3. Place each burger on the grease proof paper, cover with another sheet of greaseproof and refrigerate for about 30 mins (or until they are firm). They will hold together better on the BBQ if you do this, if you don’t then be prepared to fish bits of burger out of the charcoals.
4. Cook each one until nicely coloured on each side (about 8-10 mins per side), then top with a slice of mozzeralla and let it melt.
5. Slice the buns in two, and spread a little green pesto on the bottom slice of each one, then add a slice or 2 of tomato. Place the burger on top of this and top the mozzeralla covered patty with a couple of basil leaves, some mixed leaves and then top with the other half of the bun.
