This is a great dry rub for chicken, pork, beef... basically anything you want to marinade and BBQ. I have recently been getting into BBQ food more and more having gotten bored of the traditional British BBQ of burgers and sausages, and because I have been watching way too much Man vs Food. The BBQ restaurants in that show inspired me to make my own dry rub, the Americans get very protective of their recipes but I&#39;m quite happy to share mine here!

### Ingredients
---

*   100g Demerara sugar
*   4 heaped tsp smoked paprika
*   1 tsp sea salt
*   1 tsp celery salt
*   2 tsp mustard powder
*   2 tsp white pepper
*   2 tsp cayenne pepper
*   1 tsp ground cumin seeds
*   1 tsp ground fennel seeds
*   1 tsp ground ginger

### Method

Simple, put them all in a bowl and mix them up! This makes enough for 2 decent sized racks of ribs. If you are not making that much just put the rest in an air tight container and it will keep for ages.
