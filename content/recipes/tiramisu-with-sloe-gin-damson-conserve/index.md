First recipe of the new year and this was the dessert to the meal I cooked last night. I&#39;ve made Tiramisu many times before and I must admit I usually deviate from tradition and add morello cherries and make it more like a stodgy trifle than the usual cake you get in Italy. However, this time I didn&#39;t have any cherries to hand and I wanted to keep the shopping bill down so I used what I had to hand - Sloe gin and damson conserve (a stocking filler from Julie) and it worked a treat!

### Ingredients
---

*   250g Mascarpone cheese
*   1/4 tin of Condensed milk
*   9 Ladyfinger biscuits
*   Generous splash of Marsala wine
*   Small cup of strong espresso coffee
*   50g dark chocolate

### Method
---

1.  Make the espresso and leave to cool completely. Once it has cooled, add the Marsala wine and cold espresso to a bowl and give it a good stir. Place the ladyfingers into the mix and allow them to soak up just enough to make them soft, but no so much that they start falling apart.
2.  Line a shallow tin or a small chopping board with baking parchment and place the cooking rings on top. Break up the ladyfingers and press them into the bottom of the rings to create the base and grate some of the chocolate over the top, enough to make a decent layer.
3.  Take the conserve and place a teaspoonful in the middle of each dessert. If you are using cherries, place around 3 or 4 in each dessert.
4.  Add the mascarpone and condensed milk to a bowl and mix together well. Spoon the mixture into the rings, level off with a palette knife and grate the rest of the chocolate over the top. Transfer them to the fridge and chill for about 3 or 4 hours before serving. To get the out of the rings use a blowtorch (if you have one) or warm the rings by placing your hands on either side and allowing them to warm up before gently lifting them off.
