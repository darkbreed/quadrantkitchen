This was the starter for last nights new years eve meal, I was inspired to do this after watching a lot of festive cooking shows over the christmas period and this is a combination of watching Rachel Khoo making a quiche loraine and Rick Stein making a salmon and dill tart. These came out brilliantly for a first attempt and I&#39;ll definitely be making more tarts&#x2F;tartlets after making these, they do not require any blind baking which is also a bonus!

This recipe makes 4 tartlets.

### Ingredients
---

*   1 batch of short crust pastry
*   1 egg
*   3 egg yolks
*   100ml double cream
*   12 langoustines
*   50g cooked prawns
*   Sprig of fresh dill
*   handful of fresh chives
*   salt and pepper to season

### Method
---

1.  Make a batch of short crust pasty and chill it in the fridge for 30 mins or so. Also, butter and flour 4 small tart cases and set to one side.
2.  Add the langoustines to boiling water and simmer for about 5-10 mins to cook them through. Drain them and put them straight into cold water to stop them cooking any further. Peel and remove the heads of the prawns and langoustines and put to one side. You can keep the shells and freeze them to use in the future for a bisque or stock.
3.  Roll out the pastry so you have enough to cover all of your tart cases and press the pasty into the cases. Once all the cases are filled, use your rolling pin and roll over the top of the cases to cut any excess pastry away.Â If you need to you can repair any holes in your pastry cases with the excess you have just removed.
4.  Add the egg and 3 egg yolks to a mixer and whisk together with the cream. Roughly chop the dill and chives and add these to the bowl together with a little salt and pepper and whisk it all together.
5.  Place a few prawns and langoustine tails in each case, cover with the egg mix and place in the oven for 20 mins or until golden brown on the top. Leave to cool slightly, remove from the cases and serve warm.
