Since finding this recipe, we do not buy guacamole in jars anymore. This is so simple, but so much better than any guacamole you can buy, again it may cost a bit more but not a huge amount and the difference is amazing.

### Ingredients
---

*   2 ripe avocados
*   6 spring onions
*   2 limes
*   sea salt
*   a bunch of fresh coriander

### Method
---

1.  Halve the avocados and slice them in their skins in a criss cross pattern, turn the skins inside out into a bowl.
2.  Top and tail the spring onions, finely chop them and the coriander and put them in the bowl with the avocado.
3.  Use a fruit reamer to get all of the juice and pulp out of the limes into the bowl (but not the pips), add the salt and mash everything together with a fork. If you want it smoother use a potato masher but donâ€™t make it too smooth, it should still remain reasonably chunky.
