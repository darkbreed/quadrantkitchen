Really simple one this, very quick on the BBQ and in the oven. My philosphy with fish is just to keep it simple especially with white fish. You do not need a lot of strong flavors, just a couple to bring out the flavor of the fish.

### Ingredients
---

* 1 Sea Bass fillet
* Wedge of lemon
* Splash of dry white wine
* Sprig of dill
* Pinch of sea salt
* Olive oil

### Method
---

1. Preheat your oven to around 200C if cooking indoors. Otherwise get your BBQ grill good an hot. Pull of a decent sized piece of tin foil, and cover it with a slightly smaller piece of greaseproof paper (should be a few centimeters all the way around the edge).
2. Splash a little olive oil onto the greaseproof paper and place your fillet of Sea Bass on top, this should stop the skin sticking to the bottom. Pull the edges of the foil together and scrunch up the ends (as pictured) to create a parcel. Squeeze the lemon over the fish and put it in the parcel along with the dill, white wine & sea salt. Scrunch up the parcel to seal everything in, leaving a few inches of space above the fish. Donâ€™t wrap it up tight, it needs room to steam.
3. Place the parcels on a tray and put them in the oven for about 10 mins, alternatively as I did here they can go straight on top of a hot grill for 5-10mins. Serve them straight from the foil with some new potatoes and butter.
