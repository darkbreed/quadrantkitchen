intro: A warming winter casserole using dark ales and lean venison. Perfect for the dark, colder nights ahead...
...

Last week we spent a week in a cottage in Keswick in the Lake District. While we were there we took advantage of the local produce available in the market which runs every Thursday and Saturday. The wild venison stood out and with the weather closing in a warming casserole was definitely in order, and what better way to serve it than in a giant yorkshire pud! 

This kind of casserole really needs a dark, caramel or malt ale in order to work, anything too hoppy will make for a very bitter dish (trust me, I've done this and its not good). Sticking with the local theme, I used Jennings Sneck Lifter ale but any dark ale should work, for a west country variation on this I think Bath Ales Barnsey would work equally as well.

### Ingredients for the casserole
---

* 750g diced venison
* 2 tbsp plain flour
* Salt & pepper to season the flour
* 100g pancetta
* 1/4 cup pearled barley or spelt.
* 1 large carrot, chopped.
* 1 stick celery, chopped.
* 2 medium onion, chopped.
* 50g butter
* 1 500ml bottle dark ale
* 2 tsp tomato puree
* 1 clove garlic
* 1/2 tsp dried thyme
* 1/2 tsp dried rosemary

### Ingredients for the yorkshire puds
---

* 4 medium eggs
* plain flour
* milk
* pinch salt
* vegetable oil for cooking

### Method
---

1. In a bowl, season the flour with the salt and pepper and add the venison. Coat all of the chunks of meat as best as possible.
2. Melt 25g of the butter in a heavy casserole pan with a little olive oil to stop it burning. Once melted add the venison and brown the meat for about 10 mins or until the meat has begun to char a little on the edges, once the meat has browned, remove it and put it to one side.
3. In the same pan, add the remaining 25g of butter and fry off the pancetta until the fat has rendered out, then add the chopped celery, onions, carrot and garlic and cook until the onions have softened.
4. Add the barley, dried herbs and venison back to the pan and stir in.
6. Add in the tomato puree, stock pot and beer. All the ingredients should be covered, if not then add a little water until everything is covered.
7. Put the lid on the pan and leave to simmer for about 2 hours. 

The yorkshires...

8. After an hour its time to start the yorkshires. First things first, pre heat your oven to 220C (gas mark 9) and add about 2cm of vegetable oil to 3 20cm sandwich tins. Put these in the oven and allow the oil to get smoking hot while you prepare the batter.
9. Crack the eggs into a jug and whisk together, then add plain flour a dessert spoonful at a time until you get a paste like consistancy, it shouldn't be too stiff but should *almost* begin to come together like a dough. 
10. Once you are at this stage, add milk little by little until you get to the consistancy of single cream. The mixture should be fairly loose and just coat the back of a spoon. Put this in the fidge for 30 mins to stand and chill. 
11. Once chilled, carefully (very carefully!) open the oven and pour the mixture evenly between the oil filled pans. You need to do this quickly because as soon as the mixture hits the oil it will start cooking! Make sure the mixture covers the base of the pans then close the oven door and leave to cook for 30mins or until the tops of the puddings are golden brown. If you remove them too quickly they will sink, they will also sink if you keep opening the door to check, so make sure your oven window is clean!

Bring it all together!

12. Once the yorkies are done, remove them from the oven and fill with the casserole, seasoning to taste. Crakc open a beer and enjoy!
