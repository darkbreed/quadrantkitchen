I've made short crust pastry a few times now and after a using a few recipes I noticed a pattern, it&#39;s usually double the amount of flour to butter, with a pinch of salt and a little water to bring it together. So this afternoon I made my own based on this theory and it turned out really well. So here is my simple short crust recipe.

### Ingredients
---

*   200g plain flour
*   100g Unsalted butter
*   Pinch sea salt
*   Enough water to bring the mixture together

### Method
---

1.  Put the flour and cubed butter into a food processor with a pinch of sea salt and blitz until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs and starts to come together
2.  As soon as it looks like its forming one mass instead of breadcrumbs, keep the food processor going and pour in the water a little at a time. Literally. You only need to add a few mi at a time as its easier to add more than to take it away. Do this until the mixture comes together into a ball.
3.  Wrap the ball in cling film and chill for 30-45 mins. You can then roll this into sheets ready for use as pie tops, based etc.
