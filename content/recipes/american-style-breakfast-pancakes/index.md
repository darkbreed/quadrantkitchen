Who says you can’t use a BBQ for breakfast? Thats exactly what we did on Sunday morning and the results we pretty damn good. The only caveat is your BBQ needs a hot plate, ours comes with one but if you have a cast iron hot plate you use on your hob it will probably work just as well (you could even take it outside and stick it on the BBQ). The pancake mix recipe is based on Jamie Oliver’s recipe and its the easiest and best I have found, they are also very light and fluffy if done properly. Mine differs slightly, mainly because of what I had to hand at the time.

The main difference is the size of the eggs (it will only effect the amount of Pancakes you can make) and instead of baking powder, I am using half and half Bicarbonate of Soda and Cream of Tartar which does the same job as baking powder. This is a tip that my fiance Julie gave me, when we were preparing a gluten free meal for a friend of ours and we were not aware that baking powder is a no-no.

### Ingredients
---

* 3 medium eggs
* 115g plain flour
* 1/2tsp Bicarbonate of Soda
* 1/2tsp Cream of Tartar
* 140ml Whole (full fat) milk
* Pinch salt
* Maple syrup (proper maple syrup, not flavored golden syrup!)
* A few rashers of streaky bacon

### Method

1. While the mixer is going, pour everything else in with the egg yolks and mix to a batter. Once the two parts are ready use a spatula and fold them together and pour them into a jug, this makes it easier to pour onto the hot plate.
2. So on our BBQ we have half grill, half hot plate - perfect for cooking a pancakes best friend (crispy bacon!) on. Put a couple of rashers of bacon on the grill (or fry / under the grill if indoors) and let them get crispy. Streaky is probably best but we only had back bacon in the fridge.
3. Once your bacon is ready, pour a couple of small circles of batter onto the hot plate, making sure you leave enough space between them to allow them to spread. They literally take 30 seconds (if that) per side, so don’t pour too many out at a time otherwise they will burn while you tend to the others.
4. Stack ‘em high, top with the bacon and drown in maple syrup. Awesome.
