This is the first recipe post since coming back from our honeymoon in Scotland where we ate a lot of seafood, and as we had some tiger prawns and a side of salmon in the freezer I decided to make a fish pie. This recipe uses puff pastry instead of the usual mash and that again was due to what I had in the freezer at the time, but now I&#39;ve done it once I think I actually prefer it!

For the white fish I used Coley, I had never tried it before but its a very good alternative to cod and is very cheap (we paid 75p per 100g), so its perfect for this dish.

### Ingredients
---

*   1 whole side of Salmon (or about 6 salmon steaks)
*   300g Coley
*   12 tiger prawns
*   300g tub of Creme Fraiche
*   100g butter
*   2 tblsp plain flour
*   300ml Milk
*   250ml dry white wine
*   1 Fish stock pot or cube (I used a Knorr stock pot)
*   2 handfuls of curly Parsley
*   A small bunch of fresh dill
*   50g fresh grated parmesean cheese
*   1 egg for brushing the pastry
*   1&#x2F;2 pack of frozen puff pastry
*   2 large shallots

### Method
---

1.  Before you do anything remove the pastry from the freezer to defrost and preheat the oven to 190C.
2.  Melt the butter in a pan and add the flour. Cook the flour out for a few minutes and then add the milk and stir until you have a creamy white sauce that is just about bubbling. At this point turn the heat down so that the sauce doesn&#39;t catch on the pan.
3.  Finely chop the shallots, cut the fish into chunks and add to the sauce along with the prawns, white wine and creme fraiche. Keep the heat low and slowly poach the fish in the white sauce until the prawns have turned slightly pink.
4.  Finely chop the parsley and dill and add this to the sauce and stir it in along with the parmesan and fish stock and use the salt and pepper to season to taste. Leave this to simmer for about 15 mins while you sort the pastry out.
5.  Roll out your puff pastry so that it will easily cover the oven dish and slice off a length to use as &#39;glue&#39;. Roll this piece into a thin, sausage-like shape and stick it all around the edge of the pie dish as you will use this to make the pie crust stick a little better to the dish and seal in the contents. Transfer the contents of the pan to the oven dish and then lay the rest of the pastry over the top making sure to pinch it together with the pastry you just applied to the dish.
6.  Brush the whole pie crust with egg and make a few incisions in the lid to allow the steam to escape. Place this in the oven for around 30 mins until the crust is golden brown. When it is cooked, remove from the oven to cool a little and serve with new potatoes and asparagus.
