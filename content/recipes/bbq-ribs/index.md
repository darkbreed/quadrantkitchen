I love ribs and I have recently gotten in to BBQ food in a big way (probably through my obsession with Man vs Food). American style BBQ food goes beyond the sausages and burgers that seem to be the mainstay of British BBQ cooking, its a very traditional cooking style and is more about the flavour than just cooking outside on a sunny day. This recipe is my latest attempt at BBQ and have to say it’s my best to date, hence publishing this recipe. From doing my research (and watching a lot of Man vs Food it has to be said, it seems that there are 4 things you need for awesome BBQ ribs:

1. Good meat
2. Dry rub
3. A mop sauce
4. Patience, good ribs come with time. These take a good few hours plus marinading.

The meat should be as good as you can afford, I bought mine from Ruby & White on Whiteladies Rd in Bristol - if you are a Bristolian reading this get up there, it’s awesome and so is their meat. I cannot recommend them highly enough.

A good dry rub is essential, I have skipped it many times and simply marinaded my ribs in sauce and they are simply not as good. A good dry rub needs plenty of sugar, salt and smokiness. The salt helps draw the moisture out of the meat, the sugar then soaks this moisture up and turns into a gooey sauce that will caramelise when cooking and the smokiness… well its BBQ, its should taste smokey!

### Ingredients
---

* A big squirt of tomato ketchup
* 1 tblsp demerera sugar
* 1 tblsp dark soy sauce
* A splash of cider vinegar
* 2 tsp smoked paprika
* A pinch of cayenne pepper
* A pinch of sea salt flakes
* 2 good quality racks of pork ribs
* 1 cup of BBQ Dry rub

### Method

1. Grab your rack of ribs and with your hands rub the dry rub all over until the whole rack is covered on both sides. Don’t be shy with it, your ribs should be crimson in color when your done.

2. Once you are done, wrap the ribs in greaseproof paper (or the wax paper they came in from the butchers), place them in a baking tray and put them in the fridge for about 3 - 4 hours. Really it’s a case of the longer the better, overnight if you can but 4 hours worked well for me.

3. Next, hot smoking (which is basically smoking and cooking at the same time), so after a few hours (or the day after), get your ribs out of the fridge. You will notice that the dry rub has become a sticky glaze which means we are now ready to smoke the ribs. To smoke these ribs you need to get yourself some good smoking chips and a BBQ with a lid, I used a packet of chips made from an old Bourbon barrel and they were awesome. The need to be soaked for a little while, I left mine for about 2 hours while we went to the pub.

4. To smoke your ribs, a BBQ with 2 levels and a decent sized lid is best. As ours is gas I thought smoking would be tricky, not at all I just covered the grill and hot plate with a layer of tin foil and spread the soaked chips evenly over it. If you are using a charcoal BBQ just scatter the soaked chips over the coals. If you are using a gas BBQ turn the heat right up to get them started and then turn it down to as low as your BBQ will go and place your ribs on the second level of the BBQ and close the lid. If you are using charcoal you will probably have to keep your eye on it much more closely. Do not put them directly on the grill, if you do all of the sugary, sticky sauce created by the dry rub will burn and become bitter. I left these in the BBQ on low, lid down for around 1 and a half hours.

5. Throughout the cooking you will need to coat your ribs with a mop sauce, which is essentially a sticky glaze that creates a shell around the meat. The reason for doing this is simple, it adds the sticky, sweet glaze to your ribs that you will be used to from restaurants etc. but it also helps keep the meat moist by sealing it and keeping all the juices in.
