intro: This recipe uses my [BBQ Dry rub mix that can be found here](&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;bbq-dry-rub). Now I am by no means a butcher, but I did this at my first attempt so anyone reading this who can wield a knife and a pair of kitchen scissors should be able to do this as well.

This recipe uses my [BBQ Dry rub mix that can be found here](&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;bbq-dry-rub). Now I am by no means a butcher, but I did this at my first attempt so anyone reading this who can wield a knife and a pair of kitchen scissors should be able to do this as well. I did a bit of reading up, Googling etc. (this [video I found on Youtube](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ppa1bxB89vg) demonstrates it pretty well.) and the basic steps are:

### Ingredients
---

* 1 fresh chicken
* A few tablespoons of BBQ dry rub

### Method
---

1. Take your kitchen scissors and cut down each side of the backbone and remove it completely.
2. Turn the chicken over and cut into the breast bone from the inside.
3. Turn the chicken the right was up again and crush it with the heel of your hand to flatten it.
4. Tuck the wing tips under the breast bone and thats the spatchcock bit done.
5. The method after this is much the same as for the ribs. Score the skin on the breast and legs with a sharp knife, but not down to the bone and rub the chicken all over with the dry rub, cover it and leave it to marinade in the fridge for as long as you can, overnight is best.
6. To cook the chicken, preheat your oven to 180 degrees and cook it for around 40 mins, basting it with a BBQ mop sauce as it cooks to keep it moist.
