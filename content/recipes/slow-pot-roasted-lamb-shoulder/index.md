intro:  cooked this a few weeks back for for some family and friends and it went down a storm! If I&#39;m cooking for friends on a saturday evening I always prefer slow cooked dishes, they are so much easier to prepare, rarely go wrong and it free&#39;s up your saturday while its cooking which means you aren&#39;t stressed or busy when people arrive, anyway... I&#39;m starting to sound like Nigella so before that goes any further, here is the recipe.

I cooked this a few weeks back for for some family and friends and it went down a storm! If I&#39;m cooking for friends on a saturday evening I always prefer slow cooked dishes, they are so much easier to prepare, rarely go wrong and it free&#39;s up your saturday while its cooking which means you aren&#39;t stressed or busy when people arrive, anyway... I&#39;m starting to sound like Nigella so before that goes any further, here is the recipe.

### Ingredients
---

*   2.5kg Shoulder of Lamb
*   1 bottle dry white wine
*   2 bulbs of garlic
*   3 stalks of celery
*   2 large white onions
*   handful of fresh Rosemary
*   handful of fresh Thyme
*   a few torn Sage leaves
*   4 anchovy fillets (or a decent squirt of paste)
*   2 large carrots
*   Sea salt and black pepper to season
*   a few sprigs of fresh mint for the gravy

### Method
---

1.  Firstly, preheat the oven to 150C, then roughly chop the celery, onions and carrots and sweat them down on the hob in a large, heavy cast casserole dish until the onions have turned slightly transparent.
2.  Peel and crush the garlic cloves, chop the anchovy fillets and add the capers. Then, add the herbs to the pan along with the lamb and then pour over the wine (all of it... well all bar a sneaky glass for quality control).
3.  Season with salt and pepper, put the lid on and place it in the oven for about 6hrs. This will cook everything down slowly and once its done you should be able to pull the shoulder bone out clean.
4.  Now to make the gravy... once the lamb is ready, remove it (carefully, it will fall apart in your hands), cover it and put it to one side. Strain the liquer through a sieve to remove any stalks from the herbs and to remove the chunks of veg as these have done their job now. Pour the liquor back into the pan, add the chopped mint and reduce by half, adding in some cornflour mixed with a little water to thicken it if necessary.
5.  Serve it all up with some roast potatoes and braised red cabbage... can&#39;t beat it!
