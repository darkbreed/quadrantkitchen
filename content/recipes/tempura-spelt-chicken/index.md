Sounds a bit odd I know but trust me it’s worth doing. This is the first post in a little while due to work commitments and holidays so apologies for anyone following the blog, I’ll try to make some more regular updates. This recipe is another one for the lovely folk at Sharpham Park, I’m trying to think of as many things to do with spelt as possible at the moment and this has been the most recent success.

### Ingredients
---

*   1 cup flour (I used the white spelt flour but ordinary white flour will be fine)
*   1 medium egg
*   1 cup ice cold soda water (or ice cold water and baking soda)
*   3 large chicken breasts
*   2 tblsp dark soy sauce
*   1 tblsp chinese rice wine vinegar (or dry sherry)
*   1/2 tblsp sesame oil
*   2 cups spelt porridge flakes
*   Oil for deep frying

### Method
---

1.  First up get your deep fat frier on and heating up to about 170 C. While this is heating up mix the soy, sesame and rice wine vinegar (or sherry) together in a bowl, then slice the chicken breasts into thin strips and leave to marinate for 30 mins.
2.  While the chicken is marinading add the egg, flour and soda water to a bowl and whisk into a smooth tempura batter.
3.  Take a slice of chicken and flour it, then dip it in the batter and make sure it is well coated. Then dip it in to the spelt flakes, again making sure they are well coated, the flakes give these a real crunch and a good nutty flavor.
4.  Fry the strips in batches, do not put to many into the frier at a time otherwise you will bring the temperature of the oil down and they will take longer to cook. Fry them until they turn a golden brown color - this should take around 5 - 8 mins per batch. Fish them out with a slotted spoon and remove any excess oil with kitchen roll.
