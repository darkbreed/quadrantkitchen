I found this recipe online about a year ago now and scribbled it on the back I our bread maker manual. Good job I did as I cannot find the site again for the life of me! If you have a read maker and love pizzas, you have no excuse not to try this recipe, it’s cheaper than buying pizzas and much tastier, plus you get the satisfaction of making it yourself (ok, in a bread maker but still).

### Ingredients
---

3/4 cup of water
2 tbsp olive oil
2 cups of strong white bread flour (00 if you can get it)
1/2 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/12 tsp yeast


### Method
---

1. Stick all of the ingredients into a bread maker, close the lid and select the dough setting (usually takes about 1.5 hours in our machine). I always leave mine in for an extra hour after the machine stops to give it a little extra time to prove. One thing to remember, make sure your salt and yeast steer clear of each other as the salt will kill of the yeast and you will end up with heavy mulch.
2. Once it’s ready take it out and ''knock it back'' (beat the air out of it) then pull off as much as you need and roll into a base, obviously the more you pull off the bigger the base will be but this amount of dough normally makes 3 decent sized bases.
3. Top them with your favorite toppings and cook for about 12-15mins at 200 degrees depending on the thickness of your base. Even better, pre heat a pizza stone and cook them on this if you have one.
