intro: Up until recently I had only ever had ready made scotch eggs, making your own can be a little bit of a faff but it is well worth the effort. I don't think I have had many shop bought scotch eggs since trying these as they taste so much better when they are fresh from the fryer!

Up until recently I had only ever had ready made scotch eggs, making your own can be a little bit of a faff but it is well worth the effort. I don't think I have had many shop bought scotch eggs since trying these as they taste so much better when they are fresh from the fryer!

### Ingredients
---

*   500g sausage meat
*   4 medium eggs500g coarse breadcrumbs
*   1/2 cup flour (plus some for dusting the surfaces)

### Method
---

1.  Initial prep... put the flour and breadcrumbs into bowls, beat 2 of the eggs and put these in another bowl. We will be rolling the eggs in this lot soon! Also, pre heat your deep fat frier to 190C.
2.  Soft boil 4 eggs. I use a colour changing timer in the water with the eggs and it works a treat but according to Delia it takes about 6 minutes. Once you think you have a soft boiled egg, drain the boiling water and fill the pan with cold water. Drain and repeat this several times as the eggs will heat up the water, we want to stop the eggs cooking (and make them cool enough to peel!)
3.  Flour a surface or chopping board and divide the sausage mix up into 4 balls. Press this out into a pattie and hold in the palm of your hand (probably best to flour your hands as well) and place an egg in the center. Carefully stretch and pull the meat around the egg until the meat covers the egg completely being careful not so put too much pressure on the egg or it will burst.
4.  Roll the ball in the flour, then the beaten egg and then the breadcrumbs. Then, to get a good covering of breadcrumbs roll the ball in the egg a second time and then the breadcrumbs again. Place this to one side and repeat the process for the next 3 eggs.
5.  Place 2 of the eggs in the frier and keep your eye on them because you will need to turn them to make sure they cook properly all the way around (if you don&#39;t have a deep enough frier that is). They take around 10 mins per pair to get to a nice golden brown, once they are done remove them from the frier and drain the excess fat. Allow them too cool slightly and then tuck in, if the egg was only just soft boiled then the yolk should still be runny in the middle. If not... well, you&#39;ve still got a pretty awesome snack!
