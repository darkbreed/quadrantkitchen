Following on from my Italian style slider recipe, I thought I would try to give my next batch of sliders a mexican twist. The basic recipe for the burger mix is the same as [the mix for my italian sliders](&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;italian-style-sliders), I just substitute the Italian flavorings for Mexican.

Serve these in a soft white bun with Manchego cheese, fresh coriander, jalapeños, salsa and [fresh guacamole](&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;fresh-guacamole).

### Ingredients
---

*   400g Beef Mince
*   1 large onion (finely chopped)
*   1 medium egg (beaten)
*   2 large garlic cloves (grated)
*   Handful of coarse breadcrumbs
*   A few grinds of Sea salt and black pepper to taste.
*   A good handful of fresh coriander
*   2 tablespoons of chopped, pickled Jalapeños
*   A good grating of Manchego cheese

### Method
---

1.  Mix all of the burger mix ingredients in a bowl until they are combined. I usually find adding 2 or 3 ingredients at a time, mixing them well and then adding another 2 or 3 works best. Keep the egg &amp;amp; breadcrumbs until last.
2.  Line a baking tray with grease proof paper and once fully combined, pull away small handfuls of the mixture, roll them into a balls and then flatten into patties. I oil my chopping board to do this to save them from sticking, don’t use flour or you will end up with dry burgers!
3.  Place each burger on the grease proof paper, cover with another sheet of greaseproof and refrigerate for about 30 mins (or until they are firm). They will hold together better on the BBQ if you do this, if you don’t then be prepared to fish bits of burger out of the charcoals.
