intro: Firstly apologies for the duplicate photo - we ate this pie before I thought about uploading the recipe! Anyway... After making the fish pie we had some puff pastry left over that needed using up, and as that pie had gone down so well and we were in the mood for more I scoured the freezer and dug out some chicken legs and thighs and decided to make a chicken based pie.

Firstly apologies for the duplicate photo - we ate this pie before I thought about uploading the recipe! Anyway...

After making the fish pie we had some puff pastry left over that needed using up, and as that pie had gone down so well and we were in the mood for more I scoured the freezer and dug out some chicken legs and thighs and decided to make a chicken based pie.


### Ingredients
---

*   12 slices of chorizo
*   4 chicken legs
*   1 large white onion
*   2 cloves of garlic, minced
*   125ml double cream
*   250ml dry white wine
*   pinch of cayenne pepper
*   150ml chicken stock (or a chicken stock pot)
*   splash of lemon juice
*   salt and pepper to season
*   1 egg for brushing the pastry

### Method
---

1.  As with the fish pie recipe preheat the oven to 190C and get your puff pastry out of the freezer ready for later
2.  Roughly chop the chorizo slices and heat a splash of olive oil in a saucepan. Add the chorizo to the pan and fry it for a few minutes.
3.  Finely slice the onion, I used a mandolin to get the slices really fine but if you don&#39;t have one just slice it into rings as thinly as you possibly can and add it to the pan along with the garlic. Cook the onion down until it is soft but not browned, just let it soak up the paprika coloured oil and go soft.
4.  Dice the leg and thigh meat and add it to the pan and cook it until it starts to brown a little. Once it has started to take on some colour, add the white wine, chicken stock, lemon jiuce, cream and cayenne (in that order) and stir it all together to coat the meat.
5.  Cook this down until the mixture has reduced to a creamy sauce, it should take around 15-20 minutes. if it won&#39;t thicken properly add a little cornflour mixed with water to the mix and stir it in and season to taste.
6.  &lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;Roll out your puff pastry so that it will easily cover the oven dish and slice off a length to use as &#39;glue&#39;. Roll this piece into a thin, sausage-like shape and stick it all around the edge of the pie dish as you will use this to make the pie crust stick a little better to the dish and seal in the contents. Transfer the contents of the pan to the oven dish and then lay the rest of the pastry over the top making sure to pinch it together with the pastry you just applied to the dish.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
7.  &lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;Brush the whole pie crust with egg and make a few incisions in the lid to allow the steam to escape. Place this in the oven for around 30 mins until the crust is golden brown. When it is cooked, remove from the oven to cool a little and serve with new potatoes and some roasted red peppers.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
